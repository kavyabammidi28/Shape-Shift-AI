# 🎨 Shape Shift AI (Mini Project)

## 🧠 Overview
Shape Shift AI is a Python mini-project that can **detect geometric shapes** (circle, triangle, square, polygon) from an image and **transform or relabel them**.  
It’s a fun beginner-friendly AI + computer vision project that demonstrates **shape detection, classification, and transformation**.

## ✨ Features
- 🟢 Detects shapes from images using **OpenCV**
- 🔵 Classifies basic shapes (Triangle, Square/Rectangle, Circle, Polygon)
- 🟡 Labels shapes with bounding boxes
- 🔴 Can be extended into an **AI-powered shape classifier**
- 🎨 Future enhancement: Draw shapes on canvas and morph them

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3** 🐍
- **OpenCV** (image processing & contour detection)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- *(Optional)* scikit-learn / TensorFlow (AI classification
